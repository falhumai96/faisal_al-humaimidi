## Admit it, you came here after searching the name of my resume!!

### Also, do you think it's an awesome repo??

#### Furthermore, why are you still reading?? it's cuz it's an awesome repo, right??

##### I'm just wasting a line here................and some of ur time too :laughing:!!

###### That's a tru dedication m8. Continuing to read this repo while the font is getting smaller and smaller.

###### Opps...font can't get more smaller than this, what a sham!!

###### Still, you are an awesome person. Tho, u gotta admit, u r still in my repo!!

###### Facts time!!!

###### Ehm...why is the alphabet is organized in this order??

###### Do u know u share as much as 50% of ur DNA as banana. No wonder Minions love us.

###### Since u like banana, here's another fact: A strawberry isn't a berry but a banana is...whoo!!

###### One last fact, ur brain led u to read those facts, which was a result of other things u did in ur life, and which all were calculated to fire/block the right nerves to continue reading this fact too...let that sink in.
