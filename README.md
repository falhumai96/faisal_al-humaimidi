###### Facts time!!!

###### Do u know u share as much as 50% of ur DNA as banana. No wonder Minions love us.

###### Since u like banana, here's another fact: A strawberry isn't a berry but a banana is...whoo!!

###### One last fact, ur brain led u to read those facts, which was a result of other things u did in ur life, and which all were calculated to fire/block the right nerves to continue reading this fact too...let that sink in.
